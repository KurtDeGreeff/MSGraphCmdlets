# Microsoft Graph API Cmdlets
## Features
These cmdlets are meant to give administrators an easy way to interact with
 the Microsoft Graph API. The hope is to have the most popular features of
  MS Graph here as cmdlets.

### Current Functions
1. Get-GraphAuthenticationToken
2. Get-GraphUsers
3. Get-GraphGroups
4. New-GraphUser


## To Do
This is project is still new so there is a lot to do! 

1. Help needs to be added to working functions
2. Need funtions for other pieces of Graph
    * New-Group
    * Set-UserProperties
    * Set Group Properties
    * Files
    * Devices
    * Office 365
    * etc...
3. Need to add something that re-authenticates when the 30 minutes is up for
the authentication token.
